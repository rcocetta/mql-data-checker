# [WIP] mql-data-checker
MQL Scripts to check integrity of data, to be run as an EA.

Still work in progress: at the moment it's pretty dumb and only checks:
   * that in existent periods there are at least a minimum of ticks.
   * that there are no holes in the days.

At the moment it only works for H1
